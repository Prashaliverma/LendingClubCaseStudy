## General Information
Lending Club company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders.
Identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 

### Business Objective
Find the driving factors which lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company.

## Conclusions
### Driver variables to predict defaulters-
1. Grade
2. Interest Rate
3. Annual Income
4. Term
5. Purpose 
6. Loan amount

### Considerations for 'default' borrowers-
1. Borrowers with >10 years of experience with term 60 months.
2. Borrowers who request loan for the purpose of small business.
3. Loan provided on high interest rates (15-20%)
4. Borrowers with annual salary between 30k-50k and loan amount 4k-10k 
5. Burrowers with grades on lower side like E,F,G which indicates high risk
